# Welcome!

This is the 'lab manual' for a capstone course for neuroscience seniors, taught at Bates College. Here we introduce fundamental statistics and data science concepts, in the context of cellular neuroscience. This course use the publicly available resources of the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org), in Seattle, and works mostly with their ['Cell Types' database and API](https://celltypes.brain-map.org). Briefly, these resources allow one to explore and analyze data from thousands of neurons, across a wide range of experimental modalities (molecular, morphological, electrophysiological). 

# Intended audience

This book is meant to be accessible to anyone who's intrigued by the brain, and willing to work slowly and carefully. That said, the target audience is something like: "folks who have taken a course or two in neuroscience, feel comfortable talking about cells, synapses, and genes, but less comfortable with coding." No prior exposure to coding is presumed. 

# Funding

We acknowledge the generous support of the NSF
